# CPAN212-Modern-Web-Design-Group-Project
This is a group project made by Oshane Paul, Ibrahim Hagi, Tran Truong Quoc Bao and Ryan Pearce.

## Group Teams
The group has decided to split up into two teams. One for front-end and one for back-end. This is mostly to try to make our workflow a little easier and to allow the people in the group to work on whichever side they want.

Back-End: Ryan Pearce and Oshane Paul
Front-End: Ibrahim Hagi and Tran Truong Quoc Bao

## Group Goal
We are creating a website that will handle things you would see in an online store. This includes but is not limited to:
- Products/Items
- Product Information/Details
- Shopping Cart
- Accounts
